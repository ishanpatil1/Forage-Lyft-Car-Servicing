Run the test_car.py for running the check for servicing required for a car.

For now I have not implemented the model path as I thought that might be use full for a full automation but for now just for testing this is very functional.

In order to add more criteria you just have to add a criteria_name.py file to the appropritate folder to add another criteria and make add the same in the test_car.py file
To add another feature like the Engine and the Battery a new folder must be created with the new feature's name and new criteria must be added via adding criteria_name.py files.

This is a very crude version of this project so I might in the future update it even futher.
